In this folder, I'd like an implementation of OpenAI's Operator as a Claude MCP. What it actually
  needs to do is take a browser instance ID as a parameter (or null to make a new one), and use
  Playwright to manage the browser instances. Then use OpenAI's computer-use-preview system to
  operate the browser. The end result should be me being able to use Claude Code to fire up a
  browser session at some URL and talk with it as it interacts with the browser on my behalf,
  letting me take over now and then to log in etc.  Also, I would like to be able to run this MCP
  via a uvx command, so it needs to be able to pull in its own dependencies in whatever say uvx
  allows this. You can see sample code for how to implement this kind of operator at
  ../openai-cua-sample-app , and you can see a sample MCP server at ../chatgpt-cos.
